Currently we have:
-Basic Display
-Basic Ability

We need:
-Full Display (blit, grid map system, text system)
-Full Ability (consuming, experience)
-Full Creature (stats, abilities, xy location)
-Full Map (grid, creature pointer)
-Full User Interface (input)

Changes:
V1 Added Base Ideas

We probably should make Display contain an instance of MessageLog or move gScreen to Game. I don't like having to make messagelog get it from display.
Also we need to make MessageLog fully functional with a queue of messages.









Changes:
V2 MessageLog added, need to make it fully functional
